# The Project Management MVP web app

## Business Requirements

This project is building a Project Management App. Key features:
- A user can register, sign in, change their password, and delete their account
- Admins manage users: create, reset password, grant or revoke admin, delete
- Each user has any number of Kanban boards, each representing a project, and can share boards with other users
- Board columns can be added, renamed, reordered, and removed when empty
- Cards can be moved with drag and drop, and edited, with optional priority, due date, and labels
- Cards can be searched and filtered by text, priority, and label
- There is an AI chat feature in a sidebar; the AI is able to create / edit / move / remove cards and columns on the open board

## Limitations

A board has one owner. The owner can share it with other users as members, who can edit cards and columns and use the chat; only the owner renames, deletes, or manages members. Concurrent edits are detected with a board version, and the stale save is rejected.

This runs locally (in a docker container). The seed admin is `user` / `password`.

## Technical Decisions

- NextJS frontend
- Python FastAPI backend, including serving the static NextJS site at /
- Everything packaged into a Docker container
- Use "uv" as the package manager for python in the Docker container
- Use OpenRouter for the AI calls. An OPENROUTER_API_KEY is in .env in the project root
- Use `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free` as the model
- Use SQLLite local database for the database, creating a new db if it doesn't exist
- Start and Stop server scripts for Mac, PC, Linux in scripts/

## Starting Point

A working MVP of the frontend has been built and is already in frontend. This is not yet designed for the Docker setup. It's a pure frontend-only demo.

## Color Scheme

- Accent Yellow: `#ecad0a` - accent lines, highlights
- Blue Primary: `#209dd7` - links, key sections
- Purple Secondary: `#753991` - submit buttons, important actions
- Dark Navy: `#032147` - main headings
- Gray Text: `#888888` - supporting text, labels

## Coding standards

1. Use latest versions of libraries and idiomatic approaches as of today
2. Keep it simple - NEVER over-engineer, ALWAYS simplify, NO unnecessary defensive programming. No extra features - focus on simplicity.
3. Be concise. Keep README minimal. IMPORTANT: no emojis ever
4. When hitting issues, always identify root cause before trying a fix. Do not guess. Prove with evidence, then fix the root cause.
